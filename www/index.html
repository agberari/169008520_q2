  <p>I would leave everything here: the valleys, the hills, the paths, andl
   the jaybirds from the gardens, I would leave here the petcocks and the padres,
  heaven and earth, spring and fall, I would leave here the exit routes,
  the evenings in the kitchen, the last amorous gaze,
 and all of the city-bound directions that make you shudder</p>

    <p>I would leave here the thick twilight falling upon the land, gravity,
    hope, enchantment, and tranquillity, I would leave here those beloved
    and those close to me, everything that touched me, everything that shocked me,
    fascinated and uplifted me, I would leave here the noble, the benevolent,
    the pleasant, and the demonically beautiful, I would leave here the budding sprout,
    every birth and existence</p>

    <p>I would leave here incantation, enigma, distances, inexhaustibility, and the
    intoxication of eternity; for here I would leave this earth and these stars,
    because I would take nothing with me from here, because I’ve looked into
    what is coming, and I don’t need anything from here.</p>
